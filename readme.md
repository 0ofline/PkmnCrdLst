# Pokemon Card List

## Commissioned Website

* **Version**: 2025.5.25
* **Status**: In Development
* **Developers**: [Jideeh1](https://github.com/Jideeh1), [Kyutka3](https://github.com/0ofline)

This website project is meant to be an archive of Kuytka3's pokemon card collection under the [Paldea Evolved TCG Scarlet and Violet](https://tcg.pokemon.com/en-us/expansions/paldea-evolved/).

What I gave is just a preview hosting of its current website.
